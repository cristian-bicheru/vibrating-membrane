# Physics of Vibrating Membranes
This code was developed in conjunction to my paper analyzing the behaviour of the
2-D wave equation, in the context of vibrating membranes (think: drums). An
example of this behaviour in nature can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs56Ox86eZM

It generates looping GIF animations of the various vibrational modes for both the
rectangular and circular membrane solutions. Still plots of the modes at peak
amplitude are also produced and are included in the report.
